**Description to hw8 module:**
Call the log_parser.py with --target parameter.
In --target you can specify a file or directory.
If directory was given, script would find all logs file in this directory and process all of them.
After processing, script will create files with results in sub-directory "/results" (one file to each log file).
"not_parsed_lines" in result files show lines which not passed validation and can't be processed.
